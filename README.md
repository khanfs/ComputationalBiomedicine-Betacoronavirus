# QSAR Modelling of Chemical Compounds to Discover Potential SARS-CoV-2 Therapeutics by Predicting their Biological Activity
This repository is the culmination of collaborative research on COVID-19 with researchers from the University of Antioquia and the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford. Research is taking on a new direction - to explore the current state-of-the-art in AI and prototype computational biophysics algorithms that facilitate the development of universal antivirals. Complementing this research is work on finding a globally accessible and affordable antiviral pill.
